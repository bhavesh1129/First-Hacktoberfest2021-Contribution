Pull requests can be made in any participating GitHub or GitLab hosted repository/projects. Look for the 'hacktoberfest' topic to know if a project is participating in Hacktoberfest.

• You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31. Just be sure to sign up on the official Hacktoberfest website for your pull requests to count.
